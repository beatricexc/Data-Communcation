**EXAMPLE**:  

Sending an email: the data travels through the OSI model, adding and processing data through each layer = ENCAPSULATION 

TROUBLESHOOTING: problem with the network:  

Layer 1: are all the cables plugged in?  

Layer 2: maybe the switches have gone back 

Layer 3: is the router functioning? Do I have the right IP address?
