# Data Communications week 2 
## OSI Model Physical Layer : PDTSPA
Open system interconnection model – the model was developed by IOS – International Organization for Standardization 
The user can communicate only with the application layer 

**7th Layer** – Application layer – developers, software engineers
1-7h will interact with all the layers HTTP 
The destination number of HTTP is 80 
**6th Layer**  – Presentation Layer – it has 3 responsibilities 
compatibility
-	Encoding (ASCII)
-	Encryption (SSL)
-	Compression – (zip)
**Layer 5** – Session Layer/Management Layer – also called a management layer – simulation layer – help make multiple parallel sessions 
Eg , email , web browsing a team call – 

**Layer 4** – Transport Layer – Transmission Control protocol (TCP, UDP) – it will break down the already established data – because if one segments gets lost, we have other segments to work with
-	How are these segments built back together: each segment is assigned a distinct sequence number 

**Layer 3** – Network Layer ( this is well the network happens- router – providing the best route available 
-	This layer evaluates and decides which path or route should be taken towards the final destination 
-	In network layer, (– IP addresses  ) the segment is re-encapsulated with a header and now these segments are called packets 
**Layer 2** – Data Link Layer (here the packet is turned into a frame – 
-	Data-link layer takes the data that has come all the way from the application layer and link it to the last layer – physical layer 
-	The data is data link is called FRAME 
**Layer 1** – Physical Layer 
-	It deals with the transmission medium – transmitting the data in a binary code (0, 1)
-	It can be wired and wireless 
“Please do not throw salami pizza away” 
IP address – network layer 
Ports – layer 2 Data Link Layer 
Which command syntax analyses ports Netstat Command for 
Ex2: Scenario 2 
Email account on the company website – proof when they log in the emails are encrypted 


7th Website – Application Layer 
6th Encryption – Presentation Layer 
5th  - Session Layer – Management Layer – the session will run parallel 


Physical Layer – 
-	Establishes a Physical connectivity between the source and destination (wired DSL and fibre optic) and Wireless 
-	Physical layer is all about the 0s and 1s
Bit transmission 
Current state – will probably be in our exam 
Transition modulation – whenever there is a change it will receive a 2 

Bus Topology 
-	Lack of flexibility 
-	One way communication – there will be a COLLISION
Ring 
Bus – ring – there is no backup 
Star – Mesh – Hub they all have a backup – through a switch 

Star Topology – is the most used type of one
-	It’s really important that they are on the same page through Synchronizing Bits 
-	Bandwidth Usage 
-	Broadband is the opposite to the baseband (the internet at home) 
-	
Multiplexing Strategies:
-	Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) – freq for a certain user for a particular time 
-	Statistical – TDM – you can get to increase the time slots based on your historical data 
-	Frequency Division Multiplexing
